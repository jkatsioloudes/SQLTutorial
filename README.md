# SQLTutorial

## How can I benefit?
If you are revising SQL, need a quick how-to reference or you are just a very beginner then I hope that this is going to be a helpful step forward by a simple and well-organised material of SQL.

*PRACTISE PRACTISE PRACTISE AND.. PRACTISE MAKES PERFECT!*

In this tutorial I am making use of a database and an editor found here: https://www.w3schools.com/sql/trysql.asp?filename=trysql_op_in, but first, please have a look in the ER-diagram.png for an overview of the relations for enhanced visualisation.

## What is your motivation?
I always wanted to launch a tutorial in something I feel I know well so that other people can benefit.  I choose to start from SQL because it is simple and the exact above tutorial is what I would like to look at when I need to make use of this language.

## Can I extend it?
Sure, I am more than happy to learn from each other and hear your feedback!
